## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

This project was developed as part of the coursework for the subject **Microprocessor Measurement and Information Systems 1** at the Faculty of Technical Sciences.

The main goal was to demonstrate control of a DC motor using a PIC18F87K22 microcontroller, integrating the use of:
- PWM (for speed control)
- UART (for user interaction)
- ADC (for analog signal processing)

Project team:
